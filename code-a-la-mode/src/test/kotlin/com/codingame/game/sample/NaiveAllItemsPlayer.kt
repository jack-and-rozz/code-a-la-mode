How come you're
always such a
fussy young man?
Don't want no
Captain Crunch,
don't want no
Raisin Bran?!
Well, don't you
know that other kids
are starving in
Japan? So eat it!
Just eat it.
Don't wanna argue,
I don't wanna debate
Don't wanna hear
about what kind of
food you hate!
You won't get no
dessert 'till you
clean off your plate
So eat it. Don't you
tell me you're full,
just eat it, eat it,
eat it, eat it,
Get yourself an egg
and beat it!
Have some more
chicken, have some
more pie, it doesn't
matter if it's
broiled or fried,
Just eat it, eat it,
just eat it, eat it!
Your table manners are
a cryin' shame.
You're playin' with
your food, this
ain't some kind of
game! Now, if you
starve to death,
you'll just have
yourself to blame.
So eat it
just eat it!
You better listen,
better do what
you're told, you
haven't even
touched your tuna
casserole!
You better chow
down or it's gonna
get cold, so eat it.
I don't care if
you're full,
just eat it, eat it
Eat it, eat it.
Open up your mouth
and feed it.
Have some more
yogurt, have some
more Spam.
It doesn't matter
if it's fresh or
canned, just eat it
Eat it, eat it
Don't you make me
Repeat it!
Have a banana,
Have a whole bunch.
It doesn't matter
what you had for
lunch, just eat it!"""
